## Overview

This repository contains three professional artefacts that collectively demonstrate my professional practice as an **ICT Business Analyst**. The artefacts are based on open-source analysis and documentation and have been selected to provide **end-to-end evidence** of business analysis capability across requirements definition, business process analysis, operating model design, and data and decision modelling.

Each artefact addresses a **distinct but complementary** aspect of ICT business analysis, avoiding duplication while forming a coherent and traceable narrative.

## Artefact Summary

### Artefact 1 – Agentic AI Customer Service Requirements  
**Type:** Business and Functional Requirements Documentation  

This artefact demonstrates my ability to analyse a business problem and translate stakeholder needs into structured ICT system requirements. It defines:

- Business objectives and success criteria  
- Functional and non-functional requirements  
- Decision logic and automation rules  
- Governance, auditability, and controls  
- System behaviour for an AI-enabled customer service solution  

My contribution focused on **requirements elicitation, analysis, and documentation**, ensuring alignment between business needs and ICT system behaviour.

### Artefact 2 – Customer Service Operating Model & Process Impact Analysis  
**Type:** Business Process Analysis and Operating Model Design  

This artefact builds on Artefact 1 by examining **how customer service operations change in practice** once the solution is introduced. It demonstrates my ability to:

- Analyse the existing (AS-IS) operating model  
- Design the future-state (TO-BE) operating model  
- Define roles, responsibilities, and ownership  
- Assess change impact and transition risks  
- Establish governance and accountability for automation  

The focus is on **process ownership, organisational impact, and change management**, rather than system requirements.

---

### Artefact 3 – Customer Service Intent Taxonomy & Data Model  
**Type:** Conceptual Data Modelling and Business Taxonomy Definition  

This artefact demonstrates my ability to structure business concepts and decisions as data. It defines:

- A business-level intent taxonomy for customer queries  
- Conceptual and logical data entities  
- Relationships supporting decision traceability  
- Governance controls and auditability  
- Data structures enabling reporting and oversight  

The artefact shows how business processes and requirements are translated into **clear, governed data structures**, without implementation or code.

## How the Artefacts Work Together

| Artefact | Primary Focus | ICT Business Analysis Competencies |
|--------|---------------|------------------------------------|
| Artefact 1 | Requirements & system behaviour | Problem analysis, requirements elicitation, ICT alignment |
| Artefact 2 | Operating model & change | Process analysis, organisational design, governance |
| Artefact 3 | Data & decision structure | Data modelling, taxonomy definition, traceability |

Together, the artefacts demonstrate **end-to-end ICT business analysis**, from problem definition through to process change and data governance.

---

## Summary

The artefacts in this repository collectively demonstrate professional practice consistent with the **ICT Business Analyst** occupation. They show my ability to:

- Analyse business problems  
- Engage stakeholders and define requirements  
- Redesign business processes  
- Govern ICT-enabled automation  
- Structure business decisions and data for transparency and control  

This body of work reflects **senior-level ICT business analysis experience** and supports my claimed professional employment history.
