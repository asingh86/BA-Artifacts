# ICT Business Analyst – Professional Artefact Repository

This repository contains a curated set of professional artefacts demonstrating my practice as an **ICT Business Analyst**.  
The artefacts are based on **open-source analysis and documentation** and have been prepared to evidence end-to-end ICT business analysis capability for professional assessment purposes.

The work focuses on a customer service automation scenario using **agentic AI**, with emphasis on **business analysis, process design, governance, and data structure** rather than technical implementation.

---

## Repository Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide clear, structured evidence of:

- Business problem analysis  
- Requirements elicitation and documentation  
- Business process and operating model design  
- Governance and change impact analysis  
- Conceptual data modelling and decision traceability  

Each artefact addresses a distinct aspect of ICT business analysis and together they form a coherent, non-duplicative body of evidence.

## Artefact Relationship

The artefacts are designed to be read together:

- **Artefact 1** defines *what* the system must do  
- **Artefact 2** defines *how* the business operates with the system  
- **Artefact 3** defines *how decisions and interactions are structured as data*  

This structure avoids duplication while demonstrating end-to-end ICT business analysis practice.

## Intended Audience

This repository is intended for:

- ICT skills assessors  
- Professional reviewers  
- Stakeholders seeking evidence of ICT business analysis capability  

The documentation intentionally avoids proprietary information, implementation code, or organisation-specific details.
